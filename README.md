# Brief Description

Potholes have become a huge problem for most drivers. With the South African government spending over R22 billion over the past 3 years on pothole repair programs and the Automobile Association(AA) acknowledging more than 5% of road deaths to unmaintained road structure (potholes).

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to accurately predict the likelihood that an image contains a pothole.

# 💽 Data
The data contains images of streets in South Africa that either have potholes (positive response) or do not (negative response). The data have been split into a test and train set. The training set contains 4,026 images of test set contains 1,650 images.
